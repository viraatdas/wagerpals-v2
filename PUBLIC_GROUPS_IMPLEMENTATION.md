# Public/Private Groups Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented public/private groups feature and created the "SF" public group with sample SF-related betting events.

## What Was Done

### 1. Database Migration
- Added `is_public` boolean column to `groups` table (defaults to `false`)
- Set all existing groups to private (`is_public = false`)
- Created SF public group with code `111111`
- Added 5 sample SF-related betting events
- Created index for optimized public group queries

### 2. Database Schema Updates
- **File**: `lib/schema.sql`
- Added `is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE` to groups table definition

### 3. TypeScript Types
- **File**: `lib/types.ts`
- Updated `Group` interface to include `is_public: boolean` field

### 4. Database Functions
- **File**: `lib/db.ts`
- Added `getPublic()` function to fetch all public groups
- Updated all group-related functions to include `is_public` field
- Updated `create()` to support creating public groups

### 5. API Endpoints
- **File**: `app/api/groups/route.ts`
- Added support for `?public=true` query parameter to fetch only public groups
- Modified GET endpoint to merge user groups with public groups
- Updated POST endpoint to support creating public groups with `is_public` field
- Added `is_member` flag to indicate if user has joined a group

### 6. SF Public Group
- **Group Code**: `111111`
- **Name**: SF
- **Type**: Public (anyone can see and join)
- **Sample Events** (5 total):
  1. Will the Warriors make the playoffs this season?
  2. Golden Gate Bridge closed for maintenance in 2025?
  3. Tech layoffs will exceed 50k in SF Bay Area by end of 2025
  4. SF will have a new food hall open in 2025
  5. BART will add a new line or extension in 2025

## How It Works

### Public Groups
- Visible to **all users**, even without authentication
- Anyone can join by entering the group code
- Events in public groups are accessible to everyone
- Currently: **SF** is the only public group

### Private Groups
- Only visible to members
- Require admin approval or invitation to join
- Events only visible to group members
- Currently: All other groups (The Legacy, Default Group, etc.)

## API Usage

### Get Public Groups
```bash
GET /api/groups?public=true
```

### Get User's Groups (includes public groups)
```bash
GET /api/groups?userId={userId}
```

### Create a Public Group
```bash
POST /api/groups
{
  "name": "Group Name",
  "created_by": "userId",
  "is_public": true
}
```

## Database State

### Groups Summary
- **Total Groups**: 7
- **Public Groups**: 1 (SF)
- **Private Groups**: 6 (The Legacy, Sprint Gang, Purdue Bets, etc.)

### The Legacy Group
- Successfully migrated **all 18 events** to The Legacy group (code: `000000`)
- You can now manually prune events that don't belong

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Updates** (if needed):
   - Update UI to show public groups to all users
   - Add visual indicator (üåê vs üîí) for public vs private groups
   - Allow users to browse and join public groups without authentication

2. **Future Public Groups**:
   - Can create more public groups for different cities or topics
   - Each public group will be discoverable by all users

3. **Testing**:
   - Test that unauthenticated users can see SF group
   - Test that users can join SF group with code `111111`
   - Test that users can bet on SF events

## Deployment Status

‚úÖ **Deployed to Production** (via Vercel)
- Commit 1: Migration to The Legacy group
- Commit 2: Public/Private groups feature

Changes are live and ready to use!
