## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Stack Auth Mobile SDK**: The official Stack Auth package has React version conflicts with React Native. I've implemented a custom auth service that works with your backend API instead. This is actually more flexible.

2. **Placeholder Screens**: GroupDetail, EventDetail, CreateEvent, and GroupAdmin screens are placeholders. They show "Coming soon" and need to be implemented based on web app functionality.

3. **No Offline Support**: Currently requires internet connection. Can be added later with local caching.

4. **iOS Simulator Push**: Push notifications don't work on iOS simulator, only physical devices.

## üìû Next Actions

1. **Run the migration**: `npm run db:migrate-mobile`
2. **Test the mobile app**: `cd mobile && npm start`
3. **Implement remaining screens**: GroupDetail, EventDetail, etc.
4. **Test on physical devices**: Especially for push notifications
5. **Prepare for app stores**: Icons, screenshots, descriptions
6. **Submit for review**: When ready
