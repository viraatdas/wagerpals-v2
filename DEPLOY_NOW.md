## üìã Deployment Checklist

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables to Vercel ‚è±Ô∏è 2 minutes

**Option A: Using Vercel CLI (Recommended)**

```bash
# Public key
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY production
# Paste when prompted: BPET3DayFB3aaqpdwEp1MfiQKE2Ua2_tvpF7ZmzdCKYL4eobFMz7oARdO_0KnrbPO6jqS0yE8Db-yLZxjcByL-8

# Private key
vercel env add VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY production
# Paste when prompted: w4zJ4vESefRQQCuJTBPZcLGxK78hcP-9gXSijIAxTzs

# Subject
vercel env add VAPID_SUBJECT production
# Paste when prompted: mailto:admin@wagerpals.com
```

**Option B: Using Vercel Dashboard**

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your WagerPals project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Add these three variables for Production:

```
Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY
Value: BPET3DayFB3aaqpdwEp1MfiQKE2Ua2_tvpF7ZmzdCKYL4eobFMz7oARdO_0KnrbPO6jqS0yE8Db-yLZxjcByL-8

Name: VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY
Value: w4zJ4vESefRQQCuJTBPZcLGxK78hcP-9gXSijIAxTzs

### Step 2: Git Push ‚è±Ô∏è 1 minute

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically build and deploy! üéâ

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment ‚è±Ô∏è 2-3 minutes

- Vercel will automatically detect the push
- Build will run (~2 minutes)
- Once complete, you'll get a deployment URL

### Step 4: Test on Desktop ‚è±Ô∏è 2 minutes

1. Visit your production URL
2. Open DevTools ‚Üí Console
3. Verify: "Service Worker registered" message
4. Look for notification prompt (bottom right)
5. Click "Enable" and grant permission
6. Create a test event
7. Check that you receive a notification! üîî

### Step 5: Test on Mobile ‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes

**iOS Testing:**
1. Open Safari on iPhone (iOS 16.4+)
2. Visit your production URL
3. Tap Share ‚Üí "Add to Home Screen"
4. Open app from home screen
5. Enable notifications when prompted
6. Create an event from another device
7. Verify you get a notification!

**Android Testing:**
1. Open Chrome on Android
2. Visit your production URL
3. Tap "Install" or Menu ‚Üí "Add to Home Screen"
4. Open app from home screen
5. Enable notifications when prompted
6. Create an event from another device
7. Verify you get a notification!

## üéØ Quick Commands

```bash
# Verify everything is ready
npm run verify-pwa

# Test locally before deploying
npm run dev

# Check Vercel environment variables
vercel env ls

# View deployment logs
vercel logs

# Force a new deployment
vercel --prod
```

## üì± Expected Results

After deployment, users will:

1. **See install prompt** when visiting on mobile
2. **Be able to install** the app to their home screen
3. **Get notification prompt** after installing
4. **Receive push notifications** when new events are created
5. **Use app offline** thanks to service worker caching

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Push notifications not sending"
- Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs`
- Verify environment variables: `vercel env ls`
- Make sure values match exactly (no extra spaces)

### "Service worker not registering"
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `/service-worker.js` is accessible
- Clear cache and try again

### "Can't install on iOS"
- Must use Safari (not Chrome)
- iOS 16.4+ required for push notifications
- Follow manual "Add to Home Screen" instructions

### "Environment variables not working"
- Make sure public key has `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
- Redeploy after adding variables
- Check for typos in variable names

## ‚úÖ Final Checklist

Before calling it done:

- [ ] Environment variables added to Vercel
