# üì± iOS Push Notifications - Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è iOS-Specific Requirements

iOS has **stricter requirements** than Android for push notifications:

### 1. iOS Version ‚úÖ
- **Minimum: iOS 16.4+** (released March 2023)
- Push notifications don't work on older iOS versions
- Check: Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí About ‚Üí iOS Version

### 2. Must Be Installed as PWA ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Critical:** Just visiting in Safari is NOT enough
- Must use "Add to Home Screen" 
- Push only works when opened from the home screen icon
- Won't work when using Safari directly

### 3. Safari Only üåê
- Must use **Safari browser**
- Chrome/Firefox on iOS don't support PWA push notifications
- Check: Are you in Safari?

### 4. HTTPS Required üîí
- **localhost doesn't work on iOS** (unlike desktop)
- Must be deployed to production with HTTPS
- Vercel automatically provides HTTPS

### 5. Must Grant Permission üîî
- Notification permission must be granted IN the app
- System settings alone aren't enough
- Need to trigger subscription within the PWA

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Verify iOS Version
```
Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí About ‚Üí iOS Version
```
‚úÖ Must be 16.4 or higher

### Step 2: Deploy to Production (If Testing Locally)
```bash
# iOS requires HTTPS - localhost won't work
git push origin main
# Wait for Vercel deployment
```

### Step 3: Install as PWA in Safari

1. Open Safari on your iPhone
2. Go to: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
3. Tap the **Share button** (‚ñ°‚Üë at bottom)
4. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
5. Tap **"Add"** in the top right
6. Find the app icon on your home screen

### Step 4: Open from Home Screen

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Don't open in Safari!

1. Close Safari completely
2. Tap the WagerPals icon on your home screen
3. App should open in full-screen mode (no Safari UI)

### Step 5: Enable Notifications IN the App

1. Look for notification prompt in the app
2. Tap "Enable" button
3. When iOS asks for permission, tap "Allow"
4. ‚úÖ You should now be subscribed

### Step 6: Test with Debug Page

Visit in your installed PWA:
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/ios-test
```

This page will show you:
- ‚úÖ If you're on iOS
- ‚úÖ If app is installed (standalone mode)
- ‚úÖ If subscription is active
- ‚úÖ All requirements met

### Step 7: Send Test Notification

From another device or computer:
```bash
TEST_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app npm run test:push
```

Or use the test page button.

## üêõ Common Issues

### Issue: "I enabled notifications in iOS Settings but nothing works"

**Problem:** iOS Settings enables notifications for the app, but you also need to **subscribe within the app itself**.

**Solution:**
1. Open app from home screen (not Safari)
2. Look for the notification prompt in the app
3. Click "Enable" button
4. Grant permission when iOS asks

---

### Issue: "No notification prompt appears"

**Possible causes:**

**1. Not installed as PWA**
- Check: Do you see Safari's address bar?
- If yes ‚Üí Not installed, go back to Step 3
- If no ‚Üí Good! Continue

**2. Already dismissed prompt**
```javascript
// In browser console (while in installed PWA):
localStorage.getItem('pushNotificationPromptDismissed')
// If it returns 'true', clear it:
localStorage.removeItem('pushNotificationPromptDismissed')
// Refresh the app
```

**3. Permission already denied**
```
Go to: Settings ‚Üí WagerPals ‚Üí Notifications
Make sure "Allow Notifications" is ON
Then try subscribing again in the app
```

---

### Issue: "Push notifications still not working"

**Check these:**

**1. Are you opening from home screen?**
```javascript
// Check in console (in installed PWA):
window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches
// Should return: true
// If false ‚Üí You're not in installed PWA mode
```

**2. Is service worker registered?**
```javascript
// Check in console:
navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(reg => 
  console.log('Service worker:', reg)
);
// Should show registration object
```

**3. Do you have a subscription?**
```javascript
// Check in console:
navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(reg =>
  reg.pushManager.getSubscription().then(sub =>
    console.log('Subscription:', sub ? 'Active ‚úÖ' : 'None ‚ùå')
  )
);
```

**4. Check VAPID key:**
```javascript
// Check in console:
console.log('VAPID:', process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY);
// Should show your key (starts with 'B...')
```

### Issue: "Notifications work on desktop but not iOS"

This is usually because:
1. ‚ùå Not installed as PWA on iOS
2. ‚ùå Opening in Safari instead of from home screen
3. ‚ùå Testing on localhost (needs HTTPS/production)
4. ‚ùå iOS version < 16.4

**Solution:** Deploy to Vercel and install as PWA

5. **Visit `/ios-test`** - See what's failing
6. **Check Vercel logs** - `vercel logs` for server errors
