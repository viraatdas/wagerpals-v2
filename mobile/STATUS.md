## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
# In root directory
npm run dev
```

### 2. Run Database Migration
```bash
npm run db:migrate-mobile
```

### 3. Configure Environment
The `.env` file is already created with:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000`

For Stack Auth, add:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

### 4. Run Mobile App
```bash
cd mobile
npm start
# Press 'a' for Android or 'i' for iOS
```

---

## 📊 Test Results

### App Startup
- ✅ Expo server starts successfully
- ✅ Metro bundler compiles
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ⚠️ Push notification warning (expected in Expo Go)

### Expected Warnings
These are normal and don't affect functionality:
- `expo-notifications not fully supported in Expo Go` - Use development build for full push support
- `Must use physical device for Push Notifications` - Push doesn't work in simulators

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Testing
1. **Start backend**: `npm run dev` in root directory
2. **Run app**: `npm start` in mobile directory
3. **Test**: Try signing in, creating groups, etc.

### For Production
1. **Configure Stack Auth**: Add OAuth credentials
2. **Test on physical device**: For push notifications
3. **Build with EAS**: `eas build --platform android`
4. **Submit**: `eas submit --platform android`
